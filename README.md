Human Estimation Project
Overview
This project is focused on estimating the number, position, and movements of humans in images or videos. It uses computer vision techniques to analyze input data and generate accurate human-related metrics.

Features
Human Detection: Identifies humans in images or videos.
Pose Estimation: Predicts human body key points (such as head, shoulders, knees, etc.).
Tracking: Tracks human movement across multiple frames in a video.
Counting: Estimates the number of people in a given frame or video sequence.
Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

Python: Version 3.6 or higher.
OpenCV: For image and video processing.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: For deep learning models.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For visualizing results.
You can install these using:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/human-estimation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd human-estimation
Download pre-trained models: You will need to download the pre-trained models for human detection and pose estimation. Place them in the models/ directory.

Usage
Running on Images
Place your images in the input/ directory.
Run the following command to process the images:
bash
Copy code
python estimate_human.py --input input/image.jpg
The output will be saved in the output/ directory with human positions and key points marked.
Running on Videos
Place your video files in the input/ directory.
Run the following command to process the videos:
bash
Copy code
python estimate_human.py --input input/video.mp4
The output video will have human tracking and pose estimations overlaid and saved in the output/ directory.
Options
--input: Specify the path to the image or video file.
--output: Specify the output path (optional).
--model: Choose which pre-trained model to use (default: 'pose_model_v1').
How It Works
Human Detection: The model uses a deep neural network to detect human figures in images or video frames.
Pose Estimation: Once humans are detected, the model identifies key body parts and creates a skeleton-like structure using key points.
Tracking: In video processing, the system tracks these human figures across frames to measure movements.
Counting: The system counts the number of humans in the frame by identifying unique human shapes.

Limitations
Occlusion: The model may struggle if people are blocked by objects or overlap with each other.
Low Resolution: Performance can drop significantly in low-resolution images or videos.
Real-Time Processing: This project isn't optimized for real-time processing in its current state but can be enhanced with hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs).
Future Enhancements
Real-Time Support: Adding GPU support for real-time human estimation.
Improved Accuracy: Integrating more advanced models for better pose estimation in challenging conditions.
Multi-Class Detection: Expanding detection beyond humans to include animals, vehicles, etc.
